# Clean-Code
This is my note for the Book Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship written by Robert C Martion. I use it as a quick reference while learning. 

I'm not going through the book in order, because it's suggested not the best way of learn things. I'm also using Clean Code in Python for some of the lessions. 

Here's the schedule I'm following

## Week 1
### Chapter 1: Clean Code

#### What's code? Do we need code? 
There will always be code. Any well-specified requirements are as formal as code and cam act as executable tests of that code. Code is really the language in which we ultimately express the requirements. 

#### Bad code
Productivity decreases as time passes. Grand redesign/rewrite causes race and takes very long. It's about *attitude*. Most managers want good code, even when they are obessing about the schedule. They may defend the schedule adn requirements with passion, but that's their job. It's your job to defend the code with equal passion.

The *only way* to makethe deadline - the only way to go fast - is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times. 

What is clean code? 
elegant; efficiency; error handling should be complete; focused - each function, each class, each module exposes a single-minded attitude that remains entirely undistracted, and unpolluted, by the surrounding details; readability; easy for others to enhance it; test driven development; minimal dependencies which are explicitly defined and provides a clear and minimal API. Contains no duplication; expressiveness. 

Books can not promise to make you a good pragammer. It should you the thought process of good programmers adn the tricks, techniques, adn tools they use. 

### Chapter 2: Meaningful Names
